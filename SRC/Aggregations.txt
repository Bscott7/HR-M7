*1)  Create 2 tables.  The first table shows how many salespeople have attrition.  
*Store this information in a column called “attrition”.  
*The second table counts how many salespeople have no attrition.  
*Store this information in a column called “Non Attrition”.

SELECT COUNT(Attrition) AS Attrition
FROM employee_sales
WHERE Attrition LIKE "%Yes%"

SELECT COUNT(Attrition) AS Non_Attrition
FROM employee_sales
WHERE Attrition LIKE "%No%"



*2) Create 3 statistics tables (average, min, max) showing the monthly income for:  
*all salespeople, those with attrition and those without attrition.  
*For each table, label the columns “average_monthly_income”, “min_monthly_income”, 
*and “max_monthly_income”.

SELECT AVG(MontlyIncome) AS average_monthly_income
FROM employee_sales;

SELECT MIN(MontlyIncome) AS min_monthly_income
FROM employee_sales;

SELECT MAX(MontlyIncome) AS max_monthly_income
FROM employee_sales;



*3)  Create 2 tables containing the monthly income and count of salespeople making 
*that monthly income for: salespeople with attrition and salespeople without attrition.  
*Label the columns as: “monthlyincome” and “count”

SELECT MonthlyIncome, COUNT(MonthlyIncome) AS count
FROM employee_sales
WHERE Attrition LIKE "%Yes%"
GROUP BY MonthlyIncome;

SELECT MonthlyIncome, COUNT(MonthlyIncome) AS count
FROM employee_sales
WHERE Attrition LIKE "%No%"
GROUP BY MonthlyIncome;
